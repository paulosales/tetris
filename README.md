# tetris - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/paulosales/tetris.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/paulosales/tetris) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/paulosales/tetris/branch/dev/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/paulosales/tetris)

## Tech stack

1. [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
3. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Building

This game is coded in Typescript, so you have to transpile it to the JavaScript bundle file.
It's possible to generate two kinds of bundles: The development and the production version.

To generate the development bundle type:

```bash
yarn build
```

It also generates a map file that helps to debug the TypeScript code.

To generate the production bundle type:

```bash
yarn build-prod
```

The bundle will be generated in the folder `dist`.

## Code formatting and pattern adherence

We have eslint and prettier configured to provides code pattern checking and code formatting.

To check code pattern adherence type:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To format the code type:

```bash
yarn prettier
```

Code formatting and pattern adherence commands will be triggered every time you commit to your git repository.

## Testing

We have three test configurations types: Watching tests, Coverage tests, and Debug tests.

### Watching tests

The watching tests are tests that automatically rerun when you change the source code. To start this test just type:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Coverage tests

The coverage tests generate test coverage data.
The coverage data will be generated in the folder `coverage`.

To generate the coverage test, type:

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

### Debug tests

The debug test have the node flag `--inspect-brk` enabled. It means that when you trigger this kind of test, it will be waiting for a debugger to connect to the execution.

To trigger this kind of test, type:

```bash
yarn test:debug
```

You can use Google Chrome to debug the test. To do that just type `chrome://inspect` in the Google Chrome address bar and click in the link Inspect in the Remote Target section.
